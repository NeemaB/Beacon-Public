# Beacon

##Motivation/Opportunity

People have a limited ability to stay connected to social events going on around them. 
There is no seamless way to see what events are currently going on near your current location. 
Additionally, there is no way for small event planners to advertise to potential attendees in their area, while their event is occurring. 
BEACON solves this problem by allowing users to pin their event location and information to a shared map that all users can view in real-time. 
This app will separate itself from other platforms, such as the event planning system offered by Facebook, by not focusing as much on the planning aspect of social events. 
Instead, BEACON will try and encourage on-the-fly decision making, by focusing on nearby events that are occurring at the moment.
